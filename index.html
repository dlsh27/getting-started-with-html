  <p>The Worldwide Web is primarily a collection of HTML documents. </p>

<b><p>Major Pieces of the WWW</p></b>
1)  Your computer and browser (MS IE, Chrome, Firefox, etc.).<br>
2)  The Internet (world's largest computer network).<br>
3)  Server (computer that receives request using HTTP protocol and sends information back to browser).</p>

HTML documents are the heart of the Web.<br>
HTML documemts are made up of elements. Browsers recognize these elements through the use of tags.<br>
<p></p>Tags can be used to format text, add images and or create links to web pages. <br>
Here are examples: <b>Bold</b>, <em>Italics </em>or <a href = "www.espn.com">Sports</a>.</p>
<p>There are two types of elements - Inline & Block.  Block elements create an invisible box around content.</p>
Computers are stupid! What is meant by this is that computers interpret instructions literally.  This can turn small programming errors into large problems.
